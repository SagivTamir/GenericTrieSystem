# GenericTrySystem
This generic system is based on Trie data structure.
This means it can sort, insert, remove, search and return number of prefixes in linear by the length of the elements time complexity, O(objectMaxLength).
The system is generic:
For the class element the following methods are required:
- operator[]
- getLength() const
- char convertToElementType(int index) const

There are two examples of using the system in main.cpp.
